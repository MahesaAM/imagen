Ultra-realistic full-body photo of an Indonesian man performing Hajj, viewed from a slightly angled rear perspective. He is wearing traditional white ihram garments — the upper cloth (rida’) is loosely draped, revealing part of his back and shoulder, as is common during Hajj. He is barefoot, with no head covering, and his full black hair is clearly visible. The man is walking to the right from the viewer’s perspective. Bright natural lighting, clean white studio background. Photographic quality with realistic skin tones, fabric texture, and lifelike details. Not illustrated or cartoon-style.
